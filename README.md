# Fake video news debunker by InVID

This plugin has been designed as a verification “Swiss army knife” helping journalists to save time and be more efficient in their fact-checking and debunking tasks on social networks especially when verifying videos and images. A beta version is available at https://goo.gl/Fo8i73 and we'll be updated regularly thanks to your feedback at: **invid-verification-plugin@iti.gr**.
 
The provided tools allow you to quickly get contextual information on Facebook and Youtube videos, to perform reverse image search on Google, Baidu or Yandex search engines, to fragment videos from various platforms (Facebook, Instagram, Youtube, Twitter, Daily Motion) into keyframes, to enhance and explore keyframes and images through a magnifying lens, to query Twitter more efficiently through time intervals and many other filters, to read video and image metadata, and to apply forensic filters on still images.
