This function is used to retrieve the width and height of the bounding box of a node. The way the width and height are calculated is affected by the `options` object.

This function returns an object containing the width and height of the calculated bounding box under the `w` and `h` keys respectively. It can be used as a direct replacement for the `boundingBox()` function assuming only `w` and `h` values are needed.

```js
var options = {
  nodeDimensionsIncludeLabels: true // boolean which changes whether label dimensions are included when calculating node dimensions, default true
};

var dims = cy.nodes().first().layoutDimensions( options );
```
