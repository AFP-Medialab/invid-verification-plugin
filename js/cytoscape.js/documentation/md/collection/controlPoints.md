## Details

While the control points may be specified relatively in the CSS, this function returns the absolute [model positions](#notation/position) of the control points. The points are specified in the order of source-to-target direction.

This function works for bundled beziers, but it is not applicable to the middle, straight-line edge in the bundle.

The number of returned points for each curve style is as follows:

- `curve-style: bezier` (simple edge) : 1 point for a single quadratic bezier
- `curve-style: bezier` (loop) : 2 points for two quadratic beziers
- `curve-style: unbundled-bezier` : n points for n quadratic beziers, as the number of control points is defined by [`control-point-distances` and `control-point-weights`](#style/bezier-edges)
